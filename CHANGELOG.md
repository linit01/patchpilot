## [0.10.0-alpha] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- **In-app update checker and upgrade system** — PatchPilot can now detect new releases
  via the GitHub Releases API and apply updates directly from the Settings → Updates tab.
  - **Sidebar badge** — a pulsing cyan "Update available" indicator appears beneath the
    version tag when a newer release is found. Re-checks on every dashboard refresh cycle.
  - **Settings → Updates tab** — shows current vs latest version, release notes, channel
    (pinned or latest), install mode (Kubernetes or Docker Compose), and an "Update Now" button.
  - **Configurable check interval** — enable/disable automatic checks; interval options from
    1 hour to 1 week. Stored in the `settings` table.
  - **Kubernetes update path** — uses `kubectl set image` on both backend and frontend
    deployments, then `kubectl rollout restart` to pick up new images.
  - **Docker Compose update path** — rewrites image tags in `docker-compose.yml`, pulls new
    images with `docker pull`, then spawns a `docker:cli` helper container (same pattern as
    uninstall) that stops the old containers and runs `docker compose up -d` to bring up new
    ones. Avoids the "container can't restart itself" problem.
  - **Frontend progress UI** — progress bar with reconnect handling; polls the backend after
    restart to detect the version change and auto-reloads the page.
  - **Private repo support** — reads `GITHUB_TOKEN` from environment (env-only, never exposed
    in UI or docs) for authenticated GitHub API access.
- **CI/CD: automatic GitHub Release creation** — `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` with
  `generate_release_notes: true` added to the Docker build-push workflow. Releases are now
  created automatically when a `v*` tag is pushed. Workflow permissions upgraded from
  `contents: read` to `contents: write`.
- **Backup: standalone encryption key file** — when "Include encryption key in backup" is
  checked, a `<backup_name>_ENCRYPTION_KEY.txt` file is now written alongside the `.tar.gz`
  in the backup directory. Operators can grab the key without extracting the tarball.
- **Backup: retention protection for key-bearing backups** — `_enforce_retention()` now
  checks `backup_metadata.json` inside each archive before deletion. Backups that include
  the encryption key are never pruned by the retention policy.
- **`docker-compose-plugin`** added to the backend Dockerfile so `docker compose` (v2) works
  inside the container for the update helper.
- **`backend/update_checker.py`** — new module: GitHub API polling, version comparison
  (PEP 440 via `packaging`), update execution for both k8s and Docker, all API endpoints
  (`/api/updates/status`, `/check`, `/apply`, `/progress`).
- **`scripts/push_new_build.sh`** — helper script to automate version bump, tag, and push
  with confirmation prompts and duplicate tag handling.
- **`scripts/claude-context.sh`** — generates a base64-encoded tarball of the codebase for
  Claude AI chat sessions (excludes secrets, venvs, node_modules).

### Fixed
- **Version display on sidebar** — `app.js` now strips `-alpha`/`-beta` suffix before
  displaying in the sidebar version tag (the HTML has a separate badge for the pre-release
  label). Fixed fallback from em-dash to proper `v—` when API is unreachable.
- **Install mode detection** — `PATCHPILOT_INSTALL_MODE=k8s` is now normalized to `k3s`
  throughout the codebase (`update_checker.py`, consistent with `uninstall_api.py`'s
  cascading detection: env var → k3s kubeconfig → service account token → Docker markers).
- **`kubectl set env` pollution** — documented that `kubectl set env` bakes values into the
  deployment spec, overriding image-level `ENV` on future image tag updates. Update code
  avoids this pattern.

### Changed
- **GitHub Actions workflow** (`docker-build-push.yml`) — `permissions.contents` changed
  from `read` to `write`; added `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` step for automatic
  release creation with auto-generated changelogs.

## [0.9.7-alpha] — 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`setup_api.py`: missing `await` on `get_db_pool()`** — Two call sites in the setup-restore
  flow called `get_db_pool()` synchronously (without `await`), returning the coroutine object
  instead of the actual pool.  This caused `AttributeError` or silent failures when restoring
  from a backup during first-run setup.
- **Ansible parser: dashboard / host-detail mismatch on update counts** — When Ansible returned
  a status message claiming N updates but zero `PACKAGE:` lines were parseable, the parser
  kept the stale `total_updates` from the status message while the packages table had 0 rows.
  The dashboard showed "65 updates" but host details showed nothing.  The parser now resets
  `total_updates` to 0 when no package details are parsed and adjusts `status` accordingly,
  with warnings logged for investigation.
- **Unchecked hosts keep stale status after Ansible check** — If Ansible aborted early or a
  host was unreachable before `ignore_unreachable` could kick in, hosts that were never
  evaluated kept their old status.  `run_ansible_check_task()` now compares the expected host
  set against what Ansible actually returned and marks the gap as `unreachable` with
  `total_updates=0`.
- **`_ansible_check_lock` / `_ansible_patch_running` stuck forever** — A hanging Ansible process
  or unhandled exception could leave these flags locked permanently, blocking all future checks
  and patches until the container restarted.  Both now have monotonic-clock timeouts
  (10 min for check lock, 30 min for patch flag) with auto-clear and warning logs.
- **Periodic check loop dies silently on exception** — An unhandled exception in
  `run_ansible_check_task()` would kill the `periodic_ansible_check` coroutine permanently.
  The loop now wraps each cycle in try/except with error logging.
- **Scheduler fires before initial host check completes** — On startup (or after restore +
  restart), the scheduler could evaluate schedules before the first Ansible check populated
  host status and `total_updates`.  With stale or zero data it would either skip hosts that
  need patching or patch hosts that are already current.  The scheduler now waits on an
  `_initial_check_done` asyncio Event (120s ceiling) before its first evaluation.
- **Scheduled patches not recorded in `patch_history`** — Manual patches wrote history but
  scheduled patches did not.  `run_scheduled_patch()` now records `patch_history` rows for
  each host (success/fail, packages updated, duration, error message, raw output).
- **Scheduler re-patches already-current hosts on every tick** — The `already_ran_today` gate
  was binary: either all hosts or just the retry list.  If a schedule window was still open
  and no new updates appeared, every host got re-patched every 60 seconds.  The scheduler now
  queries each host's current `status` and `total_updates` and only targets hosts that
  actually need patching (updates > 0, not offline/unreachable) plus any explicit retry hosts.
- **Restore leaves dead connection pools** — After a DB drop/recreate during restore, the old
  `asyncpg.Pool` and `DatabaseClient.pool` objects held dead connections.  Endpoints using
  `Depends(get_db_pool)` would fail until a container restart.  `_rebuild_pool()` in
  `backup_restore.py` now rebuilds both pools, and `dependencies.py` exposes `set_pool()` /
  `rebuild_pool()` so all pool references stay in sync.
- **Setup-restore leaves pools dead** — Same issue as above but in the first-run setup flow.
  `setup_api.py` now calls `rebuild_pool()` after pg_restore and syncs the backup_restore
  module's pool reference.
- **Post-restore dashboard shows stale data until next periodic tick** — After a successful
  restore (without self-restart), the dashboard displayed whatever was in the restored DB
  without an Ansible check to verify current host state.  `backup_restore.py` now accepts a
  `set_post_restore_callback()` wired by `app.py` to trigger an immediate Ansible check.
- **`/api/hosts` returns stale data after restore or long downtime** — If all hosts have
  `last_checked` older than 2× the refresh interval (i.e. at least one full check cycle was
  missed), the endpoint now auto-triggers a background Ansible check so the dashboard
  self-heals without requiring a manual refresh.
- **Frontend: fixed countdown timer on setup/restore completion** — Replaced hardcoded 5s/18s
  redirect timers with a `/health` polling loop that enables the "Sign In" button only after
  the backend is confirmed ready, preventing login attempts against a restarting backend.
- **K8s uninstall: cleanup Job requires `privileged: true`** — The busybox Job used
  `securityContext.privileged: true` which is blocked by many PodSecurityPolicies.  Changed to
  `runAsUser: 0` only — sufficient for hostPath file deletion.
- **K8s uninstall: hardcoded `/app-data` path** — All cleanup references assumed the default
  `/app-data` directory.  The uninstall now discovers the actual data directory from PV
  hostPath specs (falling back to `PATCHPILOT_DATA_DIR` env var, then `/app-data`).
- **K8s uninstall: cleanup Job races with postgres volume mount** — The cleanup Job could run
  while postgres still held its hostPath mount, causing `rm -rf` to fail or produce incomplete
  cleanup.  Postgres and frontend are now scaled to 0 replicas (and waited on) before the
  cleanup Job starts.  The backend stays alive to orchestrate the remaining steps.
- **Backup filename glob misses new naming format** — Retention, listing, download, upload,
  delete, and health endpoints all used `glob("patchpilot_backup_*.tar.gz")`.  Centralized
  into `_is_backup_file()` / `_list_backup_archives()` helpers that recognize both legacy
  (`patchpilot_backup_*`) and new (`patchpilot_*`) naming prefixes with `.tgz` or `.tar.gz`.
- **`/api/patch/status` requires auth** — Made this endpoint public (read-only) so the frontend
  can recover from WebSocket disconnects during long patch operations without requiring a
  re-auth handshake.
- **Frontend: nginx default page shows dashboard instead of login** — Changed `index` and
  `try_files` fallback from `index.html` to `login.html` in the k8s frontend nginx config.
- **macOS check fails with `'timeout_bin' is undefined` when mas enabled** — The "Warn if no
  timeout binary" task in `check-os-updates.yml` referenced `timeout_bin.stdout` instead of
  `timeout_bin_path`.  With `mas_enabled=false` the bug was hidden by short-circuit evaluation.

### Added
- **macOS system update detection and configurable install** — New `macos_system_updates_enabled`
  setting (default `false`).  When disabled, PatchPilot detects available macOS system updates
  and reports them as `macos-system` package type but does not attempt to install them.
  When enabled, non-control nodes get `softwareupdate -iaR` and control nodes get download-only.
- **macOS system update alerts** — Dashboard alerts now include an `info`-severity alert type
  for hosts with detected macOS system updates, with blue styling in the frontend.
- **Backup configuration panel** (Settings → Backup & Restore) — New UI card to view/change
  backup storage type (local / NFS), NFS server/share, and retention count.
- **`apt-get update` before patching** — Debian/Ubuntu patch runs now refresh the apt cache
  before applying updates.
- **Ansible `--forks 5` for check, `--forks 1` for patch** — Check playbook runs with 5 forks
  for faster parallel host checking.  Patch playbook uses 1 fork (serial).
- **Ansible explicit fact gathering with unreachable handling** — Replaced `gather_facts: yes`
  with explicit `setup` task with `ignore_unreachable: true`.
- **`HOSTSTATUS` parser in `ansible_runner.py`** — Recognizes `HOSTSTATUS:` debug lines.
- **`tags: always` on binary detection tasks** — `timeout_bin`, `brew_bin` tasks.
- **Configurable data directory for k8s** — `storage.dataDir` in config.
- **Expanded RBAC for k8s uninstall** — deployments, pods, jobs verbs.
- **`/api/settings/system-info` returns `install_mode`**.
- **Log ring buffer increased to 2000 entries** with noise filtering.
- **Web installer: credentials hidden in non-developer mode**.
- **Web installer: auto-opens deployed URL** after successful install.

### Changed
- **Backup filename format** — Changed from `patchpilot_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz` to
  `patchpilot_YYYYMMDD_<4hex>.tgz`.
- **Deferred initial check** — Replaced fixed 60s sleep with a poll loop.
- **Setup/restore file validation** — Accepts both `.tgz` and `.tar.gz` extensions.
